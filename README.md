# LeetCode Daily Solutions

This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems, starting from **March 1, 2025**. Each file follows a specific naming format and includes a short description of the problem it solves.

---

## 📌 File Naming Convention
Each solution file is named using the **YYMMDD** format, representing the date it was created. For example:
- **`250301.py`** → Solution for **March 1, 2025**
- **`250302.py`** → Solution for **March 2, 2025**

## 📝 Solution Structure
Each Python file contains:
- The **LeetCode problem title** and link in comments
- My **solution implementation**
- (Sometimes) A **brief explanation** of the approach used

---

## 📂 Repository Organization
- All solutions are stored in the root directory.
- A **README** section is added at the top of each file to describe the problem.

---

## 🚀 Goals & Motivation
- **Solve at least one problem per day** 🏆
- **Improve problem-solving skills** and coding efficiency 🔥
- **Track progress over time** 📈

** SOMETIMES I UPLOAD THE NEXT DAY IF I WAS BUSY DURING THE DAY **

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements!  
Happy coding! 😊
